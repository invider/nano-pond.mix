=== Lib ===

Objects in this folder live and evolve.

You must implement some (or all) of the functions defining behavior:

* init()  - executed the first time the object is attached to /lab/...
* evo(dt) - implements object behavior (movements, physics, collisions, AI etc...), dt is delta time since the last iteration
* draw()  - draws the object

Also an object in /lab could have some of the flags defined:

* hidden - if set true, draw() is ignored and the object will not be shown
* paused - if set true, evo(dt) is ignored and the object will not be evolved
